                    <p>Welcome to Sidetrek! I want to share my personal story with you and what Sidetrek means to me.</p>

                    <p>For a long time, the thought that I don‚Äôt have one true calling bothered me. Many around me seemed to know exactly what they wanted, following that path no matter what. I had some big changes over the years both in my studies and career as my interest expanded and my worldview broadened.</p>
                    <p className="fw4">What‚Äôs wrong with me? Am I always going to start from scratch while everyone else becomes successful in their chosen path?</p>

                    <p>Then I stumbled upon a TEDx talk by Emilie Wapnick, ‚ÄúWhy some of us don't have one true calling.‚Äù According to her, I am a multipotentialite, a person with insatiable curiosity pursuing diverse interests and paths. When the new interest emerges, I learn things quickly and absorb everything related to the subject. I disappear from the world for a while because this kind of intense immersion is so fun.</p>

                    <p>Looking back, being this way helped me achieve many things: </p>

                    <div className="ml3 flex items-start"><Icon type="caret-right" className="mt2 mr3 purple-blue" />I immigrated to Canada alone when I was 24, starting everything from scratch.</div>
                    <div className="ml3 flex items-start"><Icon type="caret-right" className="mt2 mr3 purple-blue" />I left my successful Finance career at Starbucks to explore a new path in tech and startups.</div>
                    <div className="ml3 flex items-start"><Icon type="caret-right" className="mt2 mr3 purple-blue" />I started to learn to code a year ago and built three production-ready apps including Sidetrek!</div>
                    <div className="ml3 flex items-start"><Icon type="caret-right" className="mt2 mr3 purple-blue" />I even lost 30 lbs in 100 days via healthy eating and exercise to gain my health back.</div>

                    <p className="mt4">And the list goes on.</p>
                    <p>In my life, I struggled a lot as an immigrant and a multipotentialite. When I first immigrated to Canada, I stumbled and failed many times adjusting to a completely new environment. As a multipontentialite, I often felt like a misfit in a society where specialization is considered the norm. When I changed my field of study or career, I felt anxious. But I also knew I was having so much fun, accumulating life experiences I would never have had otherwise.  I developed a deep empathy towards people around me because of these rich experiences and personal struggles.</p>
                    <p>I learnt to embrace who I am.</p>
                    <p>If my story resonates with you, Sidetrek is a perfect place for you - we value diversity, creativity, and authenticity here. Find your new passion, achieve new learning goals, and explore new paths.</p>
                    <p className="fw4">Being sidetracked (or sidetreked üòâ) is not a distraction. It's the beginning of a new journey and a door to endless possibilities!</p>
